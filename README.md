# solo_project

First solo project for JTC

CATS OR DOGS?

This survey was created to get a general concensus of whether people prefer cats or dogs.
It will ask you several questions, for which you will input your response.
Some questions are general, and some more specific.
Give it a shot! Which do you prefer, cats or dogs?

You will need to run the code with python in your terminal.

Copy the code and paste it into your editor.
Save the file with a .py extension.
Run the file through your terminal - AGAIN USE PYTHON.
The survey will begin.

Enjoy!
